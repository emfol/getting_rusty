# Getting Rusty

Learning a new programming language is more than learning a new syntax.
Learning the new syntax is, of course, paramount but after writing your
first lines of code a few questions come up:

 - How can I get my hands on the interpreter or compiler for my OS?
 - How do I update my build environment?
 - How do you get the computer to run those instructions?
 - If the language is not an interpreted language, how do I build an
   executable out of those pitiful lines of code?
 - How can I reuse code from other people?
 - What is included in the standard library?
 - What are the best libraries to do X and to do Y?
 - How do I manage dependencies?
 - How do I write unit tests?

I'm probably missing a few questions here but that is enough to get us
started. The bottom line is: Learning a new language is like migrating
to a new ecosystem.

The community behind the Rust Programming Language (which is my current
focus) seems to have put a lot of effort on responding those questions
upfront.

## The **rustup** Utility

The `rustup` utility is the answer for the first couple questions.
Yes, the community implemented a script which downloads, installs
and updates all the tools for your development environment.
